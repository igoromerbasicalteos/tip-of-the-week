## Installation

### Hardware Prerequisites

- A machine with a modern CPU (Intel or AMD).
- At least 8 GB of RAM.
- Sufficient disk space to store the models you plan to use.
- A GPU is recommended but not required for better performance

### Steps

<Steps>

### Install Ollama

First, you need to install Ollama. You can do this going to [Ollama's download page](https://ollama.com/download)

### Verify that Ollama is running

Open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
ollama --version
````

The output expected looks like: `ollama version is 0.3.13`


### Search a model

Go the [Ollama's model library](https://ollama.com/library) and search for a model that suits your needs.

### Install a model

Next, you need to install the a model. You can do this using the Ollama CLI:

```bash
ollama pull <name:version>
```

Models can take up to several GBs of disk space depending on the amount of parameters they have.

### Verify Installation

To verify that the installation was successful, you can run the following command:

```bash
ollama list
```

This should list the recently installed model among the installed models. For example:

|     NAME     |       ID       |   SIZE   |    MODIFIED   |
| ------------ | :------------: | :------: |  -----------: |
| qwen2:latest |  dd314f039b9d  |  4.4 GB  |  3 weeks ago  |

### Running the Model

You can now run the model locally using the following command:

```bash
ollama run <name:version>
```

The terminal will run in prompt mode and you will start a chat with the model.

### Chatbot UI

By default the terminal doesn't have nice formatting to interact with, but you can also run the model using a [Chatbot UI](https://github.com/ivanfioravanti/chatbot-ollama)

### Next Steps

You can now [integrate the local model with the Continue extension](https://ollama.com/blog/continue-code-assistant) that gives you AI assisted coding like GitHub Copilot for free.
