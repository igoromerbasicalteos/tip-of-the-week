## Description

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Activities can be categorized into two types:
- Those that we do consciously.
- Those activities that we do unconsciously.

### The idea is that

- Human brain cannot do more than one activity that need consciousness at the same time (we are not multitask).
  - Sometimes you may think that you are multitasking, but in reality, you are switching between tasks, and it makes your brain tired.
- Humans cannot maintain their mental concentration and physical strength on a specific subject or a specific goal for a long period of time.

## About The Technique

Do you feel overwhelmed by work, tend to procrastinate, struggle with concentration or have problems meeting demanding deadlines? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you need the Pomodoro Technique!

The Pomodoro Technique is an easy and fun way to get the most out of time management. Turn time into a valuable ally to accomplish tasks while keeping track of your progress.

## Is this Technique for you?

Has anything like this ever happened to you?
- You are working on a task and you suddenly need to do other things - updating your Facebook status, working on a task of a different project, loading the dishwasher - instead of focusing on your current goal.
- You are working on a task and you hear a voice in your head: "Are you sure this is the right thing to do now? Are you sure you are not forgetting something urgent to do? Are you sure there isn't a better way to do that?
- Your deadline is approaching and completing your task on time seems impossible: the more time you work on it and the more complex it seems.
- You're constantly interrupted by other members of the team: your attention span gets smaller and smaller and you make more mistakes.
- You need to reach multiple goals by the end of the week and you don’t know what the best task to start with is.

## steps
The original technique has six steps:

<Steps>

### Decide on the task to be done

### Set the Pomodoro timer

Typically for 25 minutes.

### Work on the task.

### End work when the timer rings and take a short break

Typically 5–10 minutes.

### Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodori

### After four pomodori are done, take a long break

Typically 20 to 30 minutes instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.

</Steps>

For the purposes of the technique, a pomodoro is an interval of work time.

After task completion in a Pomodoro, any remaining time should be devoted to activities, for example:
- Review your work just completed (optional)
- Review the activities from a learning point of view (ex: What learning objective did you accomplish? What learning outcome did you accomplish? Did you fulfill your learning target, objective, or outcome for the task?)
- Review the list of upcoming tasks for the next planned pomodoro time blocks, and start reflecting on or updating them.

## Benefits
<Steps>

### Enhanced Focus and Concentration

### Improved Time Management

### Reduced Work-Related Stress

### Enhanced Team Communication and Flexibility

While each team member works on their own Pomodoro schedule, the technique encourages more structured and effective communication. By defining specific intervals for collaboration and individual work, it reduces interruptions and enables team members to plan their interaction times more effectively, including swapping pairs for different tasks or perspectives

### Adaptability to Varied Task Requirements

The Pomodoro® Technique is adaptable to different types of tasks and work styles. While the traditional Pomodoro is set at 25 minutes, the technique's real power lies in its ability to be tailored to the nature of the task, whether it requires intense concentration or more creative, free-form thinking. This adaptability makes it a versatile tool for a wide range of activities and projects.

</Steps>

## Be aware

### It can make the life mechanical

Chirillo explains in his book that **we are not supposed to manage all of our lives this way**. He even emphasizes that if you are doing something for fun and for pleasure, don't use Pomodoro timing so that it doesn't become mechanical.
